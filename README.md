This is a project started a long time ago now, probably just over a year as of December 2013. The project gained little traction over the course of 2012 and up until around October of 2013 mostly due to my working and whatnot. As of the beginning of December I've been able to start really driving to finishing this project.

##### So... what exactly is this?

This is a portfolio website. It's fairly basic but I'm also using it to explore a lot of technology that can be used in enterprise solutions. I have chosen to use the following third party technology:

 - Symfony2, this projects framework, a very mature full-stack MVC framework with a lot of features, a great community and great documentation.
 - Vagrant & Puppet, to provide a consistent development environment regardless of the machine I'm developing on, or for that matter the platform I'm developing on. Great!
 - Grunt, to manage assets and compiling resources in a structured way.
 - SASS (with Compass), to create some great stylesheets in a flexible and intelligent way.
 - The usual LAMP stack.
 - Memcached for ... caching in memory?
 - ... and probably some other bits and bats that I can't really remember for the time being.

I think, what I'm trying to say here is that this for the last month has been my PHP playground, and my learning environment for Symfony2. I feel that I've developed a very clean, efficient and well structured application so far and truly believe it will be a great website when it's done.

##### Todo List...

There is still a fair bit to do, but a lot of the core principles have been decided upon and development on this project now is easier than ever, so, onto the list:

- [x] Core components (CoreBundle)
- [ ] Security system (SecurityBundle)
  - [x] Users and groups
  - [x] Firewall
  - [ ] Account pages
- [x] Gallery system (PortfolioBundle)
- [x] Assets (AssetBundle)
- [x] Contact system (ContactBundle)
- [x] "Static" content, *homepage and about page essentially* (StaticBundle)
